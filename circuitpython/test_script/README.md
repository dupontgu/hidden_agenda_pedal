# Test Script
This directory contains a reference script - written in CircuitPython - that I use to verify the hardware is setup correctly before installing the "production" firmware. If you want to run it, follow the instructions to install CircuitPython in the [MIDI Controller docs](../midi_controller/README.md#installation).
